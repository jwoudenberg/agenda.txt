  --help              Show this help text
  --past              Show past instead of future events

Patterns:
  YYYY-MM-DD     Matches a particular date. Year, month, or day
                 can be left out, for instance:
                 1989-1-11   Matches only January 11th 1989
                 --1-11      Matches January 11th every year
                 --1-        Matches every day in January

  !YYYY-MM-DD    Exclude a particular date. Year, month, or day
                 can be left out as in the pattern above.

  <=YYYY-MM-DD   Matches all days before a particular date.

Stdin:
  Stdin expects one event per line, with the following format:
    2023-11-01 [wed <=2023-12-20] 19:30 +2:00 (CET) Dancing class

  We see, in order:
    2023-11-01           First occurence of an event (required)
    [wed <=2023-12-20]   Extra event days, using CLI patterns
    19:30                Event starting time in 24 hour clock
    +2:00                Event duration
    (CET)                Timezone of the starting time
    Dancing class        Event description
  All elements but the first occurence date are optional.
